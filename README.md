# Stop@

A framework for scalable and noise-resistant stop-move segmentation of large datasets of trajectories in outdoor and indoor spaces.


Stop@ or StopAt, targets the behavior analysis by providing a framework designed for extracting stop-move patterns from staptial trajectories, applicable across mobility data indoor or outdoor.
It is built around a stop detection method (SeqScan), it is responsible for segmenting a trajectories into segments of stop and move. 
Stop@ provides also a set of functionalities for pre-segmenation data analysis, and for analyzing the segmentation results as well.
Stop# includes the parallel processing of large datasets of trajectories.
All the functionalities can be run either using a single processor (single mode), or by parallelism using multiple proessors (bulk mode). While in the single mode the input has to be a single file referring to one moving entity, in the bulk mode the input can be either a single file referring to multiple moving entities, or a directory of single files, each for one entity.

## Installation

You need to download the project directory. 
Once you're in the project directory, you can start using the project's functionalities by calling the corresponding modules, as described in the exmaples below.

The project requires the python libraries: Pandas, json, multiprocessing, statistics, numpy, utm
You can install them using pip with the provided requirements.txt file.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Code components
The code contains 4 main modules for the 4 main functionalities explained in the section below:  `main_runSeqScan.py`, `run_statistics.py`, `run_trajectory_plotter.py`, `run_statistics_on_stops.py`.
In addition, there is the `config.json`, the configuration file where you can change the default values for variables used in the code.
The `seqscan` directory contains classes and modules utilized by the SeqScan functionality (min_runSeqScan.py), while the `tools` directory consists of classes and modules utilized by the other functionalities.
In the `input` directory, we've made available data examples, the users can use them to try and test the code and better understand the input structure requirements and expected results.
The `output` directory contains examples about the output of the functionalities when using the input files, suing different scenarios, results of the examples shown below.

### config file
The file to configure the values of these variables:
- is_cartesian: true or false; true indicates that the expected spatial coordinates in input are planar, while false means that the coordintes in input are geographic.
- The CSV_COLUMNS variables denote the fields' names in the csv files used as input. This is important for a correct parsing and interpretations of the files.
- TIMESTAMP_FORMAT: define the timestamps format
- UNITS: determine the DISTANCE and TIME units, to be adopted for the values of the segmentation algorithm's parameters and other functionalities.
- OUTPUT_COLUMNS variables denote the fields' names in the output csv files.

### input directory
The input directory contains mobility data that serves as examples for the functionalities.
The purpose is to have examples covering both planar and geographical coordinates (indoor and outdoor cases), and also to try different scenarios using single and bulk modes, i.e single file for a single moving entity, a single file containing multiple entities, and a directory of files each of which refers to one entity.

- geolife_example.csv: dataset for a __single__ person moving in the city of Beijing, China, capturing the movement of individuals in __outdoor__ settings. This dataset has been taken from the Microsoft geoLife website[2] (trajectory of user 005 on the day 24/10/2008 (20081024041230)). When working with this example, you need to modify the content of the config file accordingly (especially the *INPUT_COLUMNS*, and the *is_cartesian* has to be set to _false_)
- atc_7traj.csv: a single file representing dataset for __multiple__ persons (seven) moving in an __indoor__ place (ATC shopping center in Japan).This dataset sample has been taken from [4], and more more details about the data collection and characteristics, you can check [3]. In the config file, *is_cartesian* should be set to *true* and the *INPUT_COLUMNS* need to fit the fields' names of the file. To be noted that the *DISTANCE* unit is the millimeter.
- atc_7traj: __directory__ containing 7 single files, each refers to a single person from the ATC dataset.

### Software usage

The software presents 4 functionalities:
#### 1-SeqScan 
`main_runSeqScan.py`: the main module that extracts the stops from the trajectories
In order to undersatnd the details of the algorithm and how it works, you may refer to [1]
Seqscan is a cluster-based segmentation technique, that extract stops as clusters that are temporally non-overlapping.
It requires three parameters: the spatial density related parameters (*epsilon* and *n*) and *delta* which denotes the minimum required presence within a cluster to qualify as a "stop".
The presence refers to the effective time the entity spends within the location of the stops, excluding the abscence periods called *excursions*.

The output of this functionality consists of two components: point classification and symbolic trajectories. 
The point classification file maintains a structure similar to the input file, but  it includes four additional fields in order to denote for each point one of these cases: 
1- belonging to a stop
2- an excursion point
3- belonging to a "move" segment
4- it is a noise point   
The second file represents the symbolic trajectory, consisting of a sequence of the extracted stops. Each stop is represented by its ID, start and end time.

#### Single mode:
```python
  seqscan = mainRun()
  input_path_f = "./input/geolife_example.csv"
  output_path_f = "./output/seqscan_geolife_example.csv"
  output_path_f_symbolic = "./output/symbolic_seqscan_geolife_example.csv"
  # params: 8 m, 15 minutes, 30 points
  seqscan.run_ss_single_mode(8, 15, 30, input_path_f, output_path_f, output_path_f_symbolic)
   ``` 
#### bulk mode:
a) input is a single file of multiple entities:
With parallelism:
```python
  seqscan = mainRun()

  input_path_f = "./input/atc_7traj.csv"
  output_path_f = "./output/seqscan_atc_7traj.csv"
  #params: 1000 mm, 10 sec, 5 points
  seqscan.run_ss_multi_mode(1000, 10, 5, input_file=input_path_f, output_file=output_path_f, max_processors=3)
```
Without parallelism:
```python
  seqscan.run_ss_multi_mode(1000, 10, 5, input_file=input_path_f, output_file=output_path_f, max_processors=3)
```
 b) input is a folder of separate csv files:
 With parallelism:
 ```python
    input_path_folder = "./input/atc_7traj/"
    ##The output path is for a folder where the points classification files are going to be saved, and the folder of symbolic trajectories too
    output_path_folder = "./output/seqscan_output/"

    ## Run Seqscan, using bulk mode, with 10 processors in parallel
    seqscan.run_ss_multi_mode(1000, 10, 5,  # Seqscan parameters
                              input_folder=input_path_folder,
                              output_folder=output_path_folder,
                              max_processors=10)
   ```
Without parallelism:
```python
  seqscan.run_ss_multi_mode(1000, 10, 5,  # Seqscan parameters
                              input_folder=input_path_folder,
                              output_folder=output_path_folder
                              )
```

   plotter = RunPlotter()
   # The input is a single file of 1 trajectory
   input_path_file = "./input/atc_7traj/10340900.csv"
   #The output is a single PNG of the trajectory
   output_path_file = "./output/plot_10340900.png"
    #Plot the trajectory
   plotter.plot_single_mode(input_path_file, output_path_file)
```
#### bulk mode:
a) input is a single file of multiple entities:
With parallelism
```python
   plotter = RunPlotter()
   # The input is a single file of many trajectories

```
Without Parallelism
```python
   plotter.plot_multi_mode(input_folder=input_folder, output_folder=output_folder)
```
#### 3- Statistics over the trajectory
`run_statistics.py`. It provides statistical summaries about the trajectoryâ€™s: 
- point count
- total duration
- minimum, maximum, median, average, and standard deviation of step length and duration.
Step length is the distance between two consecutive points. Step duration is the temporal gap between them.

#### single mode
``` python
   stats=RunStatistics()
   #statistics in single mode
   input_file="./input/atc_7traj/10340900.csv"
   output_file = "./output/stats_10340900.csv"
   stats.run_statistics_single_mode(input_file, output_file)
```
#### bulk mode
a) input is a single file of multiple entities:
With parallelism
``` python
   #statistics in bulk mode, single file as input
   input_path_f = "./input/atc_7traj.csv"
   output_path_f = "./output/atc_stats_7traj.csv"
   stats.run_statistics_multi_mode(input_file=input_path_f, output_file=output_path_f, max_processors=3)
```
Without parallelism
``` python
   stats.run_statistics_multi_mode(input_file=input_path_f, output_file=output_path_f)
```

b) input is a folder of separate csv files:
With parallelism

   stats.run_statistics_multi_mode(input_folder=input_path_folder, output_folder=output_path_folder, max_processors=3)
```
Without parallelism
``` python
   stats.run_statistics_multi_mode(input_folder=input_path_folder, output_folder=output_path_folder)
```

#### 4- Statistics over the symbolic trajectories
`run_statistics_on_stops.py`. It provides statistics over the stops, results of SeqScan. More specifically it operates over the point classification file. The statistics include:
- The number of stops 
- minimum, maximum, median, average, and standard deviation of their duration.
- average presence/duration (P/D) of the stops. It is a value in ]0,1] to quanitify the quality of the stops. For details please refere to [5]

#### single mode
``` python
   # The input is a point classifications file obtained as a result of SeqScan
   input_file = "./output/seqscan_output/output_10340900.csv"
   output_file = "./output/stats_stops_output_10340900.csv"
   stops_stats.run_statistics_single_mode(input_file, output_file)
   ```

   stops_stats.run_statistics_multi_mode(input_file=input_path_f, output_file=output_path_f)
```

b) input is a folder of separate csv files:
With parallelism
``` python
   input_path_folder = "./output/seqscan_output"
   output_path_folder = "./output/stats_stops_atc_7traj/"
   stops_stats.run_statistics_multi_mode(input_folder=input_path_folder, output_folder=output_path_folder,max_processors=4)
```
Without parallelism
